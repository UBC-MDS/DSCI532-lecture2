# 1. Steps to create a production-grade app {background-color="#F1FFFA"}

## üõëü§î
#### What is a ‚Äúproduction-grade‚Äù app?
These three properties impact two specific groups: **users and the developers**.

* It is **used**, even if only by one person.

* It is **relied** upon by its user(s).

* It has **real life impact** if something goes wrong.

## The road to a production-grade app

1. Motivation and purpose
2. Select the results/metrics that you want for your target audience
3. Choose presentation method and interactivity 
4. Description of your app and sketch
5. Write the code of the app following a workflow
6. Ensure the app's reproducibility and deploy it

# Why is user center design so important?{background-color="#F1FFFA"}

---

## Develop for your users

-   As data scientists, we have the tendency to be focused on the **back-end**, i.e. the server part of the application

. . .

-   **do not underestimate the necessity for a successful front-end**

# **Step1**. Motivation and purpose  {background-color="#F1FFFA"}

## Step 1. Motivation and purpose  
**A.** Get to know well your *Persona*   
**B.** Understand the the data.

## Step 1. Motivation and purpose
#### A. Get to know well your *Persona* 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
A *persona* is a character that represents the ‚Äútypical‚Äù behavior and traits for a group of users that will interact with your product.

---

## Step 1. Motivation and purpose
#### A. Get to know well your *Persona* 

* While building your application, **you can think about how each persona will interact with a given feature**: 
   - Will they use it? 
   - Will they understand it? 
   - Do we need to add extra information?

## Step 2. Select the results/metrics that you want for your target audience

**Example 1: Business dashboard**  
* "Percentage of completion of product"     
* "Revenue increase (%) by year"     
**Example 2: COVID-19 dashboard**  
* "Number of daily COVID-19 cases by country"     
* "Percentage of COVID-19 cases"

# Step 3. Choose presentation method and interactivity{background-color="#F1FFFA"} 

---

## Step 3. Choose presentation method and interactivity 

**A.** Components (plots, maps, notifications, text).
  
**B.** Design dashboard layout.

---

## Step 3. Choose presentation method and interactivity 
#### A. Components 

**Example 1: Business dashboard**  
  
* "Percentage of completion of product" **-> Plot**  
  
* "revenue increase (%) by year" **-> Plot**   
 
---

## Step 3. Choose presentation method and interactivity 
#### A. Components 
 
**Example 2: COVID-19 dashboard**  
    
* "Number of daily COVID-19 cases by country" **-> Map**  
  
* "Percentage of COVID-19 cases" **-> Text box** 

---

## Step 3. Choose presentation method and interactivity 
#### A. Components 

**Example 1: Business dashboard**  
  
* "Percentage of completion of product" **-> Plot**  (could be a text box)
  
* "revenue increase (%) by year" **-> Plot**   (could be a text box)
 
---

## Step 3. Choose presentation method and interactivity 
#### A. Components 
 
**Example 2: COVID-19 dashboard**
  
* "Number of daily COVID-19 cases by country" **-> Map**  (could be a table)
  
* "Percentage of COVID-19 cases" **-> Text box** (could be part of a plot)


---

## Step 3. Choose presentation method and interactivity 
#### A. Components 
**What library to use to include...?**
  
* Plots   

* Gauges  

* Alerts / Notifications

* Maps    

* Text boxes  

* Reports

## General recommendation
- Good moment to check galleries of apps.
- What can of widgets/libraries are available?


---

## Plots 
#### Interactivity and animations

- [Interactive plots - the R graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/interactive-charts.html)
- [Animation plots - the R graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/animation.html)

:::footer
You can also animate this way! [Example: Shiny MRI](https://haozhu233.shinyapps.io/shinyMRI-contest/?_ga=2.184446181.270431017.1676399074-1701640703.1675377384)
:::



---

## Plots
#### `Plotly` in R?
Yes, sure!

- üìö  ![Interactive web-based data visualization with R, plotly, and shiny (2019) Carson Sievert](https://plotly-r.com/index.html)

- With `plotly` you can create [maps](https://plotly-r.com/maps.html) AND interactive plots.



---

## Plots
##### Thresholds / period selection

---

## Plots
##### `htmlwidgets`
Use JavaScript visualization libraries at the R console, just like plots

http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/

---

## Plots 
#### Interactivity and animations


‚ö†Ô∏è There are really nice libraries, but this doesn't mean that all the plots/visualizations should be interactive, some of them can be only **reactive**

You can create great visualizations with `ggplot2`!

---

## Plots
##### `ggplot2`
Don't forget that `ggplot2` has many extensions!

- [`ggplot2` extensions gallery](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/)

- [`sportyR`](https://sportyr.sportsdataverse.org/)

---

## Maps
Some libraries
- `Leaflet`
- `Plotly`
- `ggplot2`

## Step 3. Choose presentation method and interactivity 
#### B. Desing dashboard layout
  
-   [Accesibility](https://engineering-shiny.org/ux-matters.html#making-your-app-accessible)  

-   [Themes](https://mastering-shiny.org/action-layout.html#themes), fonts and size   

-   Colors

## Step 3. Choose presentation method and interactivity 
#### B. Desing dashboard layout
-   [Do we need more than one dashboard?](https://engineering-shiny.org/ux-matters.html#the-danger-of-feature-creep) 
-   [Are components that can be collapsed / expanded?](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/)
-   Titles, subtitles, labels

> **Does the organization has a particular color and layout scheme desired for the dashboards?**

## Rule of Least Surprise

# Rule of Least Surprise

When we are browsing the web, **we have a series of pre-conceptions** about what things are and what they do.

. . .

For example, **we expect an underline text to be clickable**, so there is a good chance that if you use underlined text in your app, the user will try to click on it.

---

## Layouts

- **Single page layouts** 
  - Page with sidebar   
  - Multi-row 
- **Multi-page layouts**  
  - Tabsets 
  - Navbars

## Single page layout
#### The structure underlying a simple multi-row app 


![](img/multirow.png){fig-align='center'}

**Each row is made up of 12 columns** and the first argument to `column()` gives how many of those columns to occupy.

## NavbarPage

```r
ui <- navbarPage(
  "Page title",   
  tabPanel("panel 1", "one"),
  tabPanel("panel 2", "two"),
  tabPanel("panel 3", "three"),
  navbarMenu("subpanels", 
    tabPanel("panel 4a", "four-a"),
    tabPanel("panel 4b", "four-b"),
    tabPanel("panel 4c", "four-c")
  )
)
```

# 3. How to add themes and style to your Shiny app? {background-color="#F1FFFA"}

---

## Themes
#### `bslib` package

```r
fluidPage(
  theme = bslib::bs_theme(...)
)
```

---

## Bootstrap

**Bootstrap** is the world's most popular frontend framework, providing ready-to-use templates for css and javascript, that save developers time.

What themes are available? [Click here!](https://bootswatch.com/)


---

## You can create your own theme!

üí° Use the function `bslib::bs_theme_preview()` to define your theme interactively

```r
theme <- bslib::bs_theme(
  bg = "#0b3d91", 
  fg = "white", 
  base_font = "Source Sans Pro"
)
```

---

## Themes
#### `thematic` package

`ggplot2` only:
You can use `thematic` package adding `thematic_shiny()` 

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = bslib::bs_theme(bootswatch = "darkly"),
  titlePanel("A themed plot"),
  plotOutput("plot"),
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  thematic::thematic_shiny()
  
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth()
  }, res = 96)
}

```
