# Steps to create a production-grade app {background-color="#F1FFFA"}


---

## 🛑🤔
#### What is a “production-grade” app?
* It is **used**, even if only by one person.

* It is **relied** upon by its user(s).

* It has **real life impact** if something goes wrong.

## The road to a production-grade app

1. Motivation and purpose
2. Select the results/metrics based on your target audience
3. Choose presentation method and interactivity 
4. Design the app (sketch)
5. Write the code of the app following a workflow
6. Ensure the app's reproducibility and deploy it

# Why is user center design so important?{background-color="#F1FFFA"}

---

## Develop for your users

-   As data scientists, we have the tendency to be focused on the **back-end**, i.e. the server part of the application

. . .

-   **do not underestimate the necessity for a successful front-end**

# **Step1**. Motivation and purpose  {background-color="#33cccc"}

---

## Step 1. Motivation and purpose 
Define the target audience, research question and objective of the project.
  
**A.** Get to know well your *Persona*   
**B.** Understand the the data  


---

## Step 1. Motivation and purpose
#### A. Get to know well your *Persona* 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
A *persona* is a character that represents the “typical” behavior and traits for a group of users that will interact with your product.

---

## Step 1. Motivation and purpose
#### A. Get to know well your *Persona* 

* While building your application, **you can think about how each persona will interact with a given feature**: 
   - Will they use it? 
   - Will they understand it? 
   - Do we need to add extra information?

## Step 1. Motivation and purpose
#### B. Understand the data
**How often the data will be updated?**

```{r}
data <- data.frame(category=c('strategic', 'operational', 'analytical'),
                   purpose=c('see and decide or question', 'see and act', 'See and question, explore what-if scenarios'),
                   `update frecquency` =c('moderate', 'high', 'low'),
                   interactivity = c('low', 'moderate', 'high'))

## Step 2. Select the results/metrics based on your target audience

**Example 1: Business dashboard**  
- "Percentage of completion of product"     
- "Revenue increase (%) by year"

---

## Step 3. Choose presentation method and interactivity 
#### A. Components 

**Example 1: Business dashboard**  
  
* "Percentage of completion of product" **-> Plot**  (text box???)
  
* "Revenue increase (%) by year" **-> Plot**   (text box???)
 
---

## Plots 
#### Interactivity and animations

- 👀 [Interactive plots - the R graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/interactive-charts.html)
- 👀 [Animation plots - the R graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/animation.html)
   
You can also animate using Shiny! 👀 [Example: Shiny MRI](https://haozhu233.shinyapps.io/shinyMRI-contest/?_ga=2.184446181.270431017.1676399074-1701640703.1675377384)


---

## Plots
#### `Plotly` in R?
Yes, sure!

- 📚  [Interactive web-based data visualization with R, plotly, and shiny (2019) Carson Sievert](https://plotly-r.com/index.html)

- With `plotly` you can create [maps](https://plotly-r.com/maps.html) AND interactive plots.



---

## Plots
##### `htmlwidgets`
Use JavaScript visualization libraries at the R console, just like plots

- 👀🎨 [Gallery](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/)

---

## Plots 
#### Interactivity and animations


⚠️ There are really nice libraries, **but ** this doesn't mean that all the plots/visualizations should be interactive, some of them can be only **reactive**
  
You can create great visualizations with `ggplot2`!

---

## Plots
##### `ggplot2`
Don't forget that `ggplot2` has many extensions!

- 👀🎨 [`ggplot2` extensions gallery](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/)

- 👀 [One example: `sportyR` package](https://sportyr.sportsdataverse.org/)

## Maps
  
- `Leaflet` (Interactive)  
- `Plotly`  (Interactive)
- `ggplot2` + `sf`  
there others...



---

## What we are going to learn in DSCI 532?

- `lefleat` for maps
- Some basic maps with `plotly`
- `ggplot2` + `ggplotly()` from `plotly` library



## Step 3. Choose presentation method and interactivity 
#### B. Desing dashboard layout
  
-   [Accesibility](https://engineering-shiny.org/ux-matters.html#making-your-app-accessible)  

-   [Themes](https://mastering-shiny.org/action-layout.html#themes), fonts, colors  

-   Multi-page or single-page layout

#### B. Desing dashboard layout

-   [Are components that can be collapsed / expanded?](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/)
-   Titles, subtitles, labels

# Rule of Least Surprise

When we are browsing the web, **we have a series of pre-conceptions** about what things are and what they do.

. . .

For example, **we expect an underline text to be clickable**, so there is a good chance that if you use underlined text in your app, the user will try to click on it.

# 4. How to add themes and style to your Shiny app? {background-color="#F1FFFA"}

---

## Themes
#### `bslib` package

```r
fluidPage(
  theme = bslib::bs_theme(...)
)
```

---

## Bootstrap

**Bootstrap** is the world's most popular frontend framework, providing ready-to-use templates for css and javascript, that save developers time.

What themes are available? [Click here!](https://bootswatch.com/)


---

## You can create your own theme!

💡 Use the function `bslib::bs_theme_preview()` to define your theme interactively

```r
theme <- bslib::bs_theme(
  bg = "#0b3d91", 
  fg = "white", 
  base_font = "Source Sans Pro"
)
```

---

## Themes
#### `thematic` package

`ggplot2` only:
You can use `thematic` package adding `thematic_shiny()` 





# Extras: `ggplotly()`
Check code of the second live demo
